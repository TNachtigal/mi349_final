            Hello again! As you probably know, my name is Tommy Nachtigal. I am a current Junior at Michigan State University studying to become a Video Game Level Designer. I orignally wanted to be a full Game Designer, but I took a course pertaining to exclusively level design, and have been hooked since.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been designing video games and their levels for about 3 years now, with my start being in a high school class that I helped get secured for the school.
        </p>

        <p>
            My focus on level design only started in 2022, with taking a solely level design course. However, even before then, I was making levels for other whole games I had been instructed to make.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am hoping to obtain an internship with a AAA company in order to further my education and skills through challenging situations with help from experienced mentors and peers.
        </p>
